# Hi, Friends, and welcome!

I’d like to take a moment and introduce you to the Support Team but, more importantly, I would like to introduce you to the mission of the Support Team. Our goal when speaking with you is to make sure that you feel supported through making the evacuation plan that is best for you. We want to make sure you have identified your strongest support needs are, you have at least a decent idea of what pathway would best suit your needs, and then support with the organizing, arranging, and planning through the steps and processes of that pathway. You are not alone, a lot of the Support Team are people who have also had to leave their home country; and you will speak with a member who has chosen and experienced a pathway similar to your own, as often as possible. And there is no world in where leaving behind an entire life’s worth of people, places, and things is not a heavy thing. If you are truly ready for that, or if you are truly that afraid to stay, then we are ready to help make the logistics and mechanics as easy to understand and execute as we are able.

By the time you get ready to fill out our questionnaire and get in contact with a person from the Support Team, it is important that you have read through the How-To information that is relevant for your circumstances. Please make sure that you have also read the information differentiating between traditional paths like Visas and the Asylum path; there is different criteria for each and different expectations need to be clarified. The Support Team will happily answer as many clarifying questions as we can, and direct you to better suited resources whenever needed, because we believe that there is emphasis on the word informed in the term “informed consent”. The better informed you are, from logistics to expectations, the more confident you can be in your choices and that is always our goal.

If you’re ready, we’re ready–and thank you for doing the brave thing; reaching out can be scary but asking for help is always the right choice. The best choice, for you.
