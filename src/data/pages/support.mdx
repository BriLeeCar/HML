# Support Team

## Hi, Friends, and welcome!

I’d like to take a moment to introduce you not just to the Support Team, but also to our mission.

> [!Important] <span className='text-xl font-bold'>_Our Goal_:<br/><span className='text-lg font-normal'>To make sure you feel supported in creating the evacuation plan that works best for you.</span></span>

We’ll help you identify your most important support needs, explore which pathways may suit you best, and then walk with you through the steps of organizing, arranging, and planning along that pathway.

### **You are not alone**.

Many members of the Support Team have also had to leave their home country. Whenever possible, you’ll speak with someone who has chosen and experienced a pathway similar to your own. We know that leaving behind a life—people, places, and things—is never easy. If you are truly ready to leave, or if you feel you cannot stay, we are here to make the logistics and mechanics as clear and manageable as possible.

### How to reach us

The Support Team will do our best to answer your questions and direct you to the resources that fit your situation. We believe that "**informed**" is the most important part of "**informed consent.**" The more you understand—from logistics to expectations—the more confident you can feel in your choices.

	That is always our goal.

> [!Important] Before reaching out to the Support Team
>
> 1. Please read the [How-To](/get-ready-to-leave) information provided.
> 2. Review the guide explaining the differences between traditional visa routes and the asylum path ==(link to PDF) WHAT PDF IS THIS?!==. Each has its own criteria and expectations, and it’s important to understand these in advance.

### If you’re ready, we’re ready.

Thank you for doing the brave thing. Reaching out can be scary, but asking for help is always the right choice—the best choice for you.
