> How it all starts
## Apply

- To apply for asylum, regardless of where you do so, you must be in that country. The criteria for applying for asylum are that you
    1. must be outside your home country
    2. unable to return to your home country for **well-founded fear of persecution**
    3. This persecution **must** be based on: 
        - your race
        - nationality
        - religion
        - political opinion or
        - membership in a protected demographic or community (i.e. LGBTQIA+).


> [!warning] <u>As soon as you arrive</u> you must go to either airport immigration *or* the local police station to declare your intent to seek asylum.

The receiving administration will take your identification documents, take your biometric data, and open your application.

You are legally guaranteed representation by an attorney through this process and should meet with your attorney prior to your interview and you will go over your story and evidences with that attorney.

During the process, you will be housed, fed, and given necessary medical care. You do not have to have money to apply for asylum.


## Interview
> hey

The immigration interview will be focused on what basis you have for claiming and substantiating **"well-founded fear"** of persecution in your home country. **Many things can be considered evidence** but the more personally specific, the better. 

- Often they will ask if you sought assistance from the local authorities and you will need to be able to: 
    1. Substantiate your fear resulting in choosing **not** to call authorities **OR**
    2. That you did call and were not assisted.

After your interview you will typically have another meeting with your attorney to go over the initial "intent to _____ *insert decision here, grant/deny*" response from the agency and compose a response to that intent.

> Step 3
## Decision
> Even if your initial application is denied, you can still appeal the decision. Do not lose heart!

1. For most Americans, regardless of validity of circumstance or evidence, you can expect an initial denial because of the US being considered a safe country.
2. The safe country list/policy is just that: *a policy*. The laws that host the criteria and expected response from the agency are not beholden to a policy. The judicial system is bound to honor the law above a policy.

> Step 4
## Appeal

1. Your attorney will file your appeal with the Court.
2. You will get a hearing date
    - depending on the country and track you are in, a hearing date can be anywhere from 4 weeks to 12 months away
3. You will have your case presented to a judge, including your evidence which you can add to.
4. You will get a final decision from the court.
