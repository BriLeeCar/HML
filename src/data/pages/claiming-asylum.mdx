### Quick Facts

- Asylum **is** a form of legal protection for people fleeing persecution or serious harm in their home country.
- It **isn’t** a visa for travel, work, or study.
- You **can** apply for asylum at the border or inside the country where you seek protection.
- The process **usually** involves registration, an application, an interview, and a decision.
- During the process, **you have rights** to stay, basic support, and legal help.
- **Bringing evidence of your situation can strengthen your claim.**
- Rules and procedures vary by country, so **seek local advice**.


> Eligibility
## Who Can Claim Asylum?
> You can apply for asylum if you have a well-founded fear of persecution in your home country because of at least one of the following:

- Race or ethnicity
- Religion or belief
- Nationality
- Political opinion
- Membership of a particular social group (e.g., LGBTQ+ people, survivors of gender-based violence, certain family or community groups)

You must be **physically present** in the country where you are applying (or at its border). You do not need a visa to make an asylum claim.


> The typical steps
## How the process usually works
> Exact steps vary by country, but most asylum systems follow a similar pattern

1. **Declare your intent** – Tell border officials, police, or the asylum office that you want protection.
2. **Registration** – Authorities record your personal details and may take fingerprints or photos.
3. **Application** – You fill out forms and explain why you cannot safely return home.
4. **Interview** – You describe your story and reasons for seeking protection (an interpreter is usually provided).
5. **Decision** – Officials decide whether you qualify for:
    - **Refugee status** – Usually includes residence rights, work authorization, and eventual long-term stay.
    - **Subsidiary or humanitarian protection** – Shorter permits if you face serious harm but do not meet the refugee definition.
    - **Rejection** – Your application may be refused. You often have the right toappeal.
6. **Appeal** – If refused, you may have a right to challenge the decision in court. Deadlines are short.


> Basic Rights
## Your basic rights during the process
> While your case is being examined, you generally have the right to

- Have your claim heard fairly *(with an interview and interpreter if needed)*
- Stay in the country until a decision is made
- Receive basic shelter, food, or support *(this differs by country)*
- Access at least emergency healthcare
- Get free or low-cost legal help from NGOs or legal aid providers
- Appeal a negative decision within set deadlines

**You may also have duties (attending appointments, living in assigned accommodation, reporting regularly to authorities).**


> Evidence
## Evidence that can help
> If you do not have documents, you can still apply. Explain clearly why documents are missing.

- Bring what you can safely carry, such as:
  - Identity documents (passport, ID card, birth/marriage certificates)
  - Proof of threats or harm (police or court reports, medical records, letters, social media posts, photos, news articles)
  - Membership or affiliation documents (party cards, union membership, LGBTQ+ or activist group records)

> Other Considerations
## Good to know!
> Many countries allow you to apply for family reunification after recognition.

- You can **usually** request an interpreter in your language
- You may be able to ask for a female or male interviewer/interpreter if you feel unsafe.
- If you are LGBTQIA+ or a survivor of violence, tell legal advisors so they can request safer housing or confidentiality measures.
- Travel during the asylum process is usually restricted. Once recognized, you may be issued a refugee travel document.

> FAQ
## Common Questions about Asylum
> Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about asylum.

- **Do I lose my citizenship if I am granted asylum?**
  - No. Asylum gives you legal protection in your host country, but you remain a citizen of your country of origin. You may later apply for citizenship in your host country, but that is a separate process. Some countries allow dual nationality; others may require you to renounce your original citizenship.

- **Does asylum give me permanent residence or citizenship right away?**
  - Not usually. First you are given a temporary protection status (often renewable). Permanent residence or citizenship usually comes later and only after meeting specific requirements, such as a certain period of residence, language proficiency, and integration into society.

- **Can I travel while my asylum claim is pending?**
  - Normally no. Most countries require you to stay while your claim is being processed. After recognition, you may receive a refugee travel document, but you usually cannot travel back to your home country.

- **Can my family join me?**
  - Many countries allow family reunification if your asylum claim is accepted. The definition of “family” varies (often spouse/partner and children under 18). You will need to apply separately for family members to join you.

- **Can I work while waiting for a decision?**
  - Rules differ. Some countries let you work after a waiting period, others restrict work until your claim is approved. Always check national laws and seek legal advice if possible.

- **What happens if my claim is refused?**
  - You usually have the right to appeal within a short deadline. If your appeal is unsuccessful, you may be asked to leave or could be returned to your home country — unless you qualify for another form of legal stay.
