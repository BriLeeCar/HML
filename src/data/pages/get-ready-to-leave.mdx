## Get Your Documents Ready
> Having your documents in order is essential before starting a visa or asylum application. Missing paperwork can delay or derail your process.

### Core Documents
- Passport (valid, with at least 6 months before expiry)
- Birth Certificate (certified copy)
- REAL ID (or equivalent government-issued ID)
- Proof of Address (utility bill, lease, or bank statement)
- Marriage/Divorce Certificates (if applicable)
- Children’s Documents (birth certificates, custody papers if needed)
- Financial Records (bank statements, tax returns if applying for visas)

### Choose Your Exit Pathway
Decide whether to leave through a visa route (work, study, family, digital nomad) or by claiming asylum.

- **Visa routes** are best if you meet eligibility requirements (job offer, university place, financial proof). They are more stable, often lead to residency, and allow family reunification.
- **Asylum routes** are for those facing real persecution (political, religious, ethnic, LGBTQIA+, etc.). They are free to apply but risk rejection, especially if your country is considered “safe.”
