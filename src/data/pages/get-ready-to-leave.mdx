# Get Ready to Leave

So you want to leave? Preparation is **critical** to getting you, and the people you care about, out safely and quickly.

## Get Your Documents Ready

Having your documents in order is essential before starting a visa or asylum application. Missing paperwork can delay or derail your process.

### Core documents

- Passport (=r=valid, with at least 6 months before expiry==)
- Birth Certificate (=r=certified copy==)
- REAL ID (=r=or equivalent government-issued ID==)
- Proof of Address (=r=utility bill, lease, or bank statement==)
- Marriage/Divorce Certificates (=r=if applicable==)
- Children’s Documents (=r=birth certificates, custody papers if needed==)
- Financial Records (=r=bank statements, tax returns if applying for visas==)

## Choose Your Exit Pathway

Decide whether to leave through a visa route (work, study, family, digital nomad) or by claiming asylum.

- **Visa routes** are best if you meet eligibility requirements (job offer, university place, financial proof). They are more stable, often lead to residency, and allow family reunification.
- **Asylum routes** are for those facing real persecution (political, religious, ethnic, LGBTQIAq+, etc.). They are free to apply but risk rejection, especially if your country is considered “safe.”
