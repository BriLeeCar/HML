> Who We Are
## We are every day people.
Help Me Leave is a volunteer-driven project created by people who understand the fear, urgency, and difficulty of leaving home when it no longer feels safe. Many of us have lived through migration ourselves, and we know how overwhelming it can be to navigate complex systems while facing threats to your rights, safety, or survival.

> Why We Do It
## Why We Do It
> Because everyone deserves a chance to be safe.



No one should have to face the choice of leaving home without support.
- Everyone deserves access to accurate, up-to-date information.
- Informed decisions are safer decisions.


> Our Goal
## What we do
> We provide clear, reliable information on visas, asylum, and relocation pathways, along with step-by-step guides to help you make the best plan for your situation.

- Collect and share official, verified information on [visa](/explorer) and asylum options.
- Provide practical “how-to” resources to help you prepare.
- Connect you with a [Support Team](/support) of people who have walked this path before, whenever possible.

## Why we exist
Millions of people are now facing deteriorating political and legal conditions that put them at risk—especially LGBTQIA+ people, women, immigrants, and people of colour. For many, relocation has become not just a choice but a necessity. Help Me Leave exists to make sure you don’t have to face that journey alone.

## Our promise
We can’t take away the pain of leaving, but we can make the process clearer, the choices easier to understand, and the path forward less frightening. If you’re ready to take the next step, we are here to help.
