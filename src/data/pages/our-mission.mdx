> Who We Are
## We are every day people.
> Help Me Leave is a volunteer-driven project created by people who understand the fear, urgency, and difficulty of leaving home when it no longer feels safe.

Many of us have lived through migration ourselves. We know how overwhelming it can be to navigate complex systems while facing threats to your rights, safety, or survival. Others on our team simply believe that no one should have to face the choice of leaving home without support.

All of us are united by a shared belief that **everyone deserves access to accurate**, up-to-date information, and that **informed decisions are safer decisions**.

### Why we exist
Millions of people are now facing deteriorating political and legal conditions that put them at risk—especially LGBTQIA+ people, women, immigrants, and people of colour. For many, relocation has become not just a choice but a necessity. Help Me Leave exists to make sure you don’t have to face that journey alone.

> Our Goal
## Our goal 
> We try to provide clear, reliable information on visas, asylum, and relocation pathways, along with step-by-step guides to help you make the best plan for your situation.

- Our primary goal is to provide as much help as possible by collect and share official, verified information on [visa](/explorer) and asylum options.
- Provide practical [“how-to” resources](/guides-resources) to help you prepare.
- Connect you with a [Support Team](/support) of people who have walked this path before, whenever possible.


### Our promise
We can’t take away the pain of leaving, but we can make the process clearer, the choices easier to understand, and the path forward less frightening. If you’re ready to take the next step, we are here to help.
