# Help me Leave NOW

## How to Start

When you need to leave the country quickly, you have two main paths: **visas** and **asylum**. Each has its own requirements, benefits, and risks.

- **As a general rule**:
  - Visas are better if you meet the requirements
  - Asylum is necessary if you cannot return safely.

> [!empty]- 1. Tourist Visa
>
> - There are lots of places where American citizens can get lengthy tourist visas either immediately or very quickly.
> - However, many work or study visas have to be applied for **FROM** your home country.
> - May also affect your ability to apply for asylum in your target country.

> [!empty]- 2. Work or Study Visa
>
> - Often requires a sponsor (employer, university, or family) or significant funds.
> - Strict eligibility: financial proof, documents, background checks.
> - Processing can take weeks or months.
> - If approved → residence permit, more stable long-term option.
> - If denied → **you may still explore other visa options.**

> [!empty]- 3. Asylum
>
> - Only for people with a well-founded fear of persecution (e.g. political opinion, religion, race, sexuality, social group).
> - Must usually apply on arrival in the country of refuge.
> - Free to apply; temporary housing, food, and medical support are often provided during the process.
> - If denied → **possible entry bans or forced return.**
