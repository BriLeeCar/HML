# Top Asylum Options

## Brazil

- The Brazilian Refugee Law considers as a refugee every person who leaves his/her country of origin because of well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, or due to a situation of grave and widespread human rights violation in his/her country of origin. This can happen, for example, when the personâ€™s life, liberty or physical integrity is at serious risk in his/her country.
