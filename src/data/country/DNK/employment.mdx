### How People Are Making Money

The average household income is USD _33,774.00 per year_ and that is compared to the average US household, coming out at USD 30,490.00 per year. It is also important to note that the **unemployment percentage in Denmark is only 2.6%**. The reason for this is that Denmark has social systems designed to encourage a high rate of mobility between occupations. They encourage people to work different jobs and get specific education relating to switching to your new interest. Whether you are fired or quit, you can rely on the “social security” to kick in, virtually overnight. The average work week is 33 hours. At the beginning of 2024, Denmark also began instituting **4 day work weeks** and it has been highly successful with employers and employees alike, so that structure is likely to grow.
