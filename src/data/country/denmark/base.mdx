## Social Life

### How People Socialize

From readily available online sources, it seems that Denmark actually associates their economic and social structure success to the tight knit communities they have had for generations. People often go out for food or drinks after a work day, it is common to work conversations into your store trips, and people seem to generally have a supportive and helpful attitude.

There is also a strong community connection to nature. People often spend their free time exploring or enjoying the land around them, especially the hot springs.

### Social Amenities {{className: 'text-xl'}}

    Beaches, forests, and preserved parks are everywhere in Denmark. The country also has a lot of museums, including “open air” museums, and art centered recreational activities.

### Holidays {{className: 'text-xl'}}

    Denmark has similar holidays to the U.S., some even being the same (*christmas, easter, a constitution day, etc*). The foods eaten and local celebratory traditions vary but are, essentially, very similar.

### Socially Expected Public Behavior {{className: 'text-xl'}}

    While it is still considered polite to offer seats to elderly women, that is really all that is left of “chivalry” in Denmark. That notion has been replaced with **equal and reciprocal respect between genders and ages**. Timeliness is very important, as is scheduling or booking ahead. The biggest faux pas in Denmark is to treat someone as if they are incapable or to be disrespectful.

## Economy

### How People are Making Money {{className: 'text-xl'}}

    Firstly, let's be clear on the **USD to DKK** (*Danish currency is called a kroner*):

> $1.00 = 6.90DKK

Despite the confusing currency exchange, it is encouraging to know that the average cost of living in Denmark is 21% less than that of the average in the US. And that is also without the addition of health insurance costs or vehicle payments or insurance costs. Also, there are a **significant amount of tax exemptions** citizens can claim, as well.

The average household income is USD _33,774.00 per year_ and that is compared to the average US household, coming out at USD 30,490.00 per year. It is also important to note that the **unemployment percentage in Denmark is only 2.6%**. The reason for this is that Denmark has social systems designed to encourage a high rate of mobility between occupations. They encourage people to work different jobs and get specific education relating to switching to your new interest. Whether you are fired or quit, you can rely on the “social security” to kick in, virtually overnight. The average work week is 33 hours. At the beginning of 2024, Denmark also began instituting **4 day work weeks** and it has been highly successful with employers and employees alike, so that structure is likely to grow.
