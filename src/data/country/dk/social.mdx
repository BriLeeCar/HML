## Social Life

### How People Socialize

From readily available online sources, it seems that Denmark actually associates their economic and social structure success to the tight knit communities they have had for generations. People often go out for food or drinks after a work day, it is common to work conversations into your store trips, and people seem to generally have a supportive and helpful attitude.

There is also a strong community connection to nature. People often spend their free time exploring or enjoying the land around them, especially the hot springs.

### Social Amenities

    Beaches, forests, and preserved parks are everywhere in Denmark. The country also has a lot of museums, including “open air” museums, and art centered recreational activities.

### Holidays

    Denmark has similar holidays to the U.S., some even being the same (*christmas, easter, a constitution day, etc*). The foods eaten and local celebratory traditions vary but are, essentially, very similar.

### Socially Expected Public Behavior

    While it is still considered polite to offer seats to elderly women, that is really all that is left of “chivalry” in Denmark. That notion has been replaced with **equal and reciprocal respect between genders and ages**. Timeliness is very important, as is scheduling or booking ahead. The biggest faux pas in Denmark is to treat someone as if they are incapable or to be disrespectful.
