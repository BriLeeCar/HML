I left behind the Georgia red clay that stained my
                childhood knees.
    I abandoned the mountains: Yonah, Blood, and
Currahee. I will never again see their purple shadows
against a sunset.
          The autumn color wheel of bright orange, yellow,
and deep crimson is lost to me now.

    I forsook Appalachia, in all her natural glory and grace.
      I couldn’t stay and age with her, no more could I wait;
                            My bones will not rest in her soil.

                Her people have been poisoned,
                  Blinded with cloths of hate.
Fear is a powerful currency and it bought her inhabitants’
                          votes.

For people like me – who identify differently than the sex
  assigned to them at birth, safety in her communities
                disappeared overnight.
    Spit from a frothing, enraged, Granny soiled my shoes
              when I last tried to get food for my children.

I say I have left her – Appalachia – but perhaps that is not
quite true; I was driven from her hollars and hills by those
           who would rather I never existed at all.

        I will still keep a broom beside my threshold;
               An iron horseshoe above my door.
I will still tell the tales of her haints and haunts but I won’t
                      fear their gaze anymore.

  I carry the Memories and Magick from her ancient land
              In my frightened and weary bones.
    I will see that the stories of her people are kept alive
             Here, on new and hope-filled shores.
