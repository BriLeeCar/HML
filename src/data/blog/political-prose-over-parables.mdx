In this work, I want to try to make a different kind of appeal; I want to use a biblical parable to try to compare and explain what has happened to the United States, and what we can do going forward. I do not personally follow any tenets of Christianity, but I know them very well. I want to offer the Parable of the Talents from the New Testament and I want the moral of that particular allegory to resonate with the circumstances unfolding—in real time—in America. All hope is **not** lost and we can rebuild; but the whole people will have to abandon any sentiment of "_I don’t really do politics_" or "_it doesn’t affect me_"; if it doesn’t already, it will. <U>It’s no longer an option to "be political", it is a duty.</U>

### Matthew 25:14-30

In the _Parable of the Talents_, a master entrusts three of his servants with talents (a unit of measure for precious metals) while he leaves for a short time. Two of those servants invested the talents entrusted them and doubled the amount they were left with; the master regarded their initiative and said "_you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much_", meaning they had shown such faithfulness to him and his betterment that he would bequeath them with honors and even more powers and responsibility. Their care over what was his resulted in receiving more than they had, for themselves. But the last servant, he did not invest or take action to grow the sum his master entrusted to him. He buried the talent, keeping it exactly as it was, to return to his master when he came to collect. The master was wrathful, saying "_from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away_". And he cast his "_wicked and slothful servant_" out into the night.

The Baby Boomers and Generation X were "wicked and slothful" servants. They had more rights and freedoms in their adulthoods than the generations before them...and their lazy and disinterested attitudes towards "politics", their neglect to preserve and grow the freedoms and progress they so greatly enjoyed with affirmative and forward investment in "politics", has left younger generations with less rights to enjoy in their adulthoods than what was available to them as children. Millennials, Generation Z, Generation Alpha; all of us have less rights to our autonomy and less freedom of speech, movement, public gathering, and expression than what we grew up being told we could have "once you’re 18". In just 10 years America has gone from one of the most socially progressive countries in the world to one of the most oppressive. The democracy America was so proud of is dead and rotting; Trump's authoritarian regime has murdered it.

Democracy is never a guaranteed or static structure; democracy lives and breathes through its own employment. The phrase "if you don’t use it, you’ll lose it" is often used in reference to physical strength or flexibility or, sometimes, in reference to cognitive agility. But it should be just as deeply understood in its application to rule for and by The People. Only 22.7% of the voting population, in America, actually voted for Donald Trump’s second term in office. 22.1% voted for Kamala Harris; 24.7% of the voting population did not vote. Now, some percentage of those people could not vote because of the reduction of mail-in voting, gerrymandering, or complete inability to get to the polling locations, but plenty of them kept the "I’m not into politics" perspective or didn’t think it mattered if they voted or not. The rest of the population—including minors, residents, and refugees—were ineligible to vote. I offer all those figures and sums because I am attempting to make the point that _a larger percentage of the voting population didn’t vote, at all, than either of the percentages for the respective candidates did_. This is "wicked and slothful". This is taking no interest in preserving or bettering the state of the nation. They didn’t use their right to vote; and now a terrifying amount of Americans have lost that right entirely.

American democracy has been murdered by the Trump Regime, there is no doubt of that; but the huge swaths of people who didn’t care enough to participate in the democratic process aided and abetted this authoritarian coup. The rights, protections, and services that were given a generation or two before have been, or are in the process of being, gutted. Entire demographic minorities are being targeted by public and government entities alike. Eugenics has a new face and so does White Supremacy; it’s the White House Emblem. And it will take more than peaceful protests and strikes to undo what has been done. No resurrection will be possible, a new nation will have to be created, labored over, and born. And birth is never bloodless.

I do not wish to give the impression that all hope is lost; it isn’t. But the wisps of hope will vanish into the winds of history if people do not take action. There can be no more disinterest. There can be no more lazy or careless regards towards "politics". It isn’t about party lines or religious alignment anymore, it is about the rights and actual lives of the American people. If all of the executive atrocities have not yet affected you, I promise you they will; just give it a little time. No one is safe, or will be for much longer. And the only way to save the entire nation will be to put your various grievances and differences aside and unite. We must stand together, locked arm in arm, and declare that we will have our rights to our autonomy and freedom. We must do so with the resolve to take it back, if it is not given to us. Organize, my friends. Creating networks and communities, cooperative sharing of resources and information is no longer a nice idea: it is vital. We The People must build our nation from the ground up; just like a fetus must grow and form from cellular to systematic, we too must gather, merge, split and specialize into a country. And we can do this. We must.
