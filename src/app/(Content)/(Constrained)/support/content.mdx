  1. Prescribed
  2. Well Trained
  3. Tasking

This allows you to retain control of your life. You decide where you work, where you live, and have flexibility of choice. Most of these paths are renewable and a longterm path to additional citizenship or permenant residence permission.

Asking for entrance to a country because you need international protection from individuals that your government will not protect you from or from the government itself and no other body of influence in your home country can protect you from the government. It can lead to citenzship, in some countries, but during the process of seeking and claiming asylum, you may not have any choice in where you live or whether or not you work, where you work.
