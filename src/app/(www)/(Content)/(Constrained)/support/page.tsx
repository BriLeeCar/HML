				We’ll help you identify your most important support needs, explore which pathways may suit
				you best, and then walk with you through the steps of organizing, arranging, and planning
				along that pathway.

			<Text>
				Many members of the Support Team have also had to leave their home country. Whenever
				possible, you’ll speak with someone who has chosen and experienced a pathway similar to your
				own. We know that leaving behind a life—people, places, and things—is never easy. If you are
				truly ready to leave, or if you feel you cannot stay, we are here to make the logistics and
				mechanics as clear and manageable as possible.
