		"limits": "PROOF OF FIANCIAL ABILITY LETTER FROM SPONSOR If you’re going to be financed by an institution while in Brazil or if you have a scholarship, a grant or a paid fellowship, you must present a letter from the awarding institution stating how much you’re going to be paid, what expenses are covered and for how long they’re going to cover you. OR PROOF OF INCOME Brazilian law requires that if you don’t have a scholarship, a grant, a paid fellowship or if no person or institution is financing you while in Brazil, you must prove that you’re financially capable of maintaining yourself during your intended stay in Brazil, possessing financial means compatible with those of an international student. All the information provided is confidential under law penalties and securely stored while your visa is processed. Brazilian law demands that you present proof of income of the last 90 days (“all last 3 months”, not just “1 of the last 3 months”). You may choose from one of the options below: 1. OPTION 1: Pay stubs They must contain your name, the company/institution you work for, and the amount you earn. 2. OPTION 2: Bank statements They must contain your name, initial and final balance and total of credit and debit. For US banks, the first page (summay) of each month usually contains the information we need (initial and final balance, total of credit and debit and your name), so you may avoid wasting paper by selecting only those pages. If you wish, you may use correcting tape or fluid to omit your account number. 3. OPTION 3: Bank statements for business owners If you own a business and decide to use your business’s statements, you must provide proof that you own it, for example, by printing the results from sunbiz.org (for Florida-based companies only) showing your name as the owner. 4. OPTION 4: Credit card statements They must contain your name and the available credit. Credit card statements without credit limit must show the amount of expenses and payments made. What if I don’t have any of those? You may present an Affidavit of Support accompanied by: 1. Your sponsor’s ID (original if he or she comes to the interview with you, or a notarized copy, if they can’t come to the interview). The ID must contain a photo and signature. The signature on the affidavit of support must match the one on the ID presented. 2. Your sponsor’s proof of income (one of the options aforementioned). The affidavit of support must be notarized if your sponsor can’t be present at the visa interview. Your sponsor can’t be someone in Brazil. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Holders of a student visa may only engage in paid activities while in Brazil if the workload is compatible with the study/internship/interchange schedule; interns may receive internship grants. Regular courses and student interchanges must have a minimum of 15 hours of study/internship per week. Registration with the Federal Police (DPMAF) within 90 days of arrival in Brazil.
