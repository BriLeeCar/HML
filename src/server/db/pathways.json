If abroad, you can submit the application at the Estonian embassy handling the TRP applications. \nHow to apply? Book an appointment at the Police Board or at the Estonian embassy for the residence permit process.\nDocuments needed? Can be found here. Add proof of funds, health insurance coverage, and a cover letter explaining your business in Estonia. Process up to 2 months. \nFamily members TRP?

This minimum required income will allow for the applicant to take two legal dependents to Brazil.

Applicants must lodge their application in person (not required for the dependents).

Only after the receipt of this approval can the visa be issued. Once approved, visa must be issued within 6 months. Within 30 days of arrival in Brazil, bearers of these types of visas must register with the Brazilian Immigration authorities (The Federal Police Department-DPMAF) and submit a copy of the visa application form, provided to them by this Embassy upon collection of the visa.",

		"description": "Every country has its own laws and rules about becoming a citizen. Ireland is no different. So, how do you become an Irish citizen by naturalisation? There are three main ways you can apply for Irish citizenship by naturalisation:\n\n    1 You have legally lived in Ireland for five years\n    2 You are married to or in a civil partnership with an Irish citizen\n    3 You are applying on behalf of a minor.\n\nIf you are in Ireland as a refugee, you can also become an Irish citizen after three years. We have a system in place to help you through the citizenship process.\n\nEach pathway to citizenship has its own specific requirements, which are explained below. However, generally you must:\n\n    Have the correct identity documents to prove who you are\n    Have the correct residency documents to prove that you have legally lived in Ireland for the correct number of years\n    Reach the correct total score on the citizenship scorecard system.\n\nAll citizenship applications are processed by the Citizenship Division in Immigration Service Delivery (ISD).",
